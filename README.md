<h1>Local Music Notifications</h1>

This app is going to send me a daily email, text, or some other
kind of notification of whichever bands are playing at 
all of my favorite local venues around Seattle.


Each email should include:  Venue names, the bands performing, and a link to the band's Spotify page to check them out without 
having to search myself.

I'm starting off by using TicketMaster API calls 
to get the relevant info, and then I'll resort to scraping for any venues
that don't have easy API access for their show info.

Long live rock 'n' roll.
